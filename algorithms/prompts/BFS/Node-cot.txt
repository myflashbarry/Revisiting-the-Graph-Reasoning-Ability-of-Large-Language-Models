Q: Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. The graph is: G describes an undirected graph among 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
In this graph:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 2, 5, 3.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 5, 7, 3.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, 6.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, 6.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6.
 The question is: Does a path exist between node 2 and node 6? If a path exists, present the BFS path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If no path is found, state "No path." This problem will be addressed using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Let's think step by step.
A: 1. Node 2 is directely connected with nodes 0, 1, 3, 4.
2. From node 0, we can reach nodes 1, 7, 2, 5, 3. 
3. From node 1, we can reach nodes 0, 2, 6, 5, 7, 3.
4. From node 6, we have reached our target.
So a path from node 2 to node 6 does exist. The BFS path taken in this search is:
Node 2 -> Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 6.

Q: Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. The graph is: G describes an undirected graph among 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
In this graph:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 5, 10.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 10, 5, 6.
Node 2 is connected to node 4.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 9, 4, 7.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 10.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 10.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 9, 8.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7.
Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5.
 The question is: Does a path exist between node 6 and node 7? If a path exists, present the BFS path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If no path is found, state "No path." This problem will be addressed using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Let's think step by step.
A: 1. Node 6 is directely connected to nodes 0, 1, 10.
2. From node 0, we can reach nodes 1, 6, 5, 10.
3. From node 1, we can reach nodes 0, 10, 5, 6.
4. From node 10, we can reach nodes 0, 1, 5.
5. From node 5, there are no further connections that lead us closer to node 7.
Looking at the connections, we notice that none of the directly or indirectly connected nodes from node 6 include node 7.The graph essentially splits into two disconnected components, with nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10 in one component and nodes 2, 4, 3, 9, 7 and 8 in another. since node 7 is not in the same component as node 6, there is no path between node 6 and node 7.
No path.

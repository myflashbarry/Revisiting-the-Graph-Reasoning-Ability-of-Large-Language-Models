Qï¼šDetermine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. The graph is: G describes an undirected graph among node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
Node 0 is connected to node 1.
Node 0 is connected to node 7.
Node 0 is connected to node 2.
Node 0 is connected to node 5.
Node 0 is connected to node 3.
Node 1 is connected to node 2.
Node 1 is connected to node 6.
Node 1 is connected to node 5.
Node 1 is connected to node 7.
Node 1 is connected to node 3.      
Node 2 is connected to node 3.
Node 2 is connected to node 4.
Node 3 is connected to node 4.
Node 3 is connected to node 7.
Node 3 is connected to node 6.
Node 4 is connected to node 5.
Node 4 is connected to node 7.
Node 4 is connected to node 6.
Node 5 is connected to node 6.
Node 6 is connected to node 7.
The question is: Is there a path between Node 2 and 6? If a path exists, present the BFS path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If no path is found, state "No path." This problem will be addressed using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Let's think step by step.
A: 1. Start at node 2. The neighbors are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
2. Visit node 0. The neighbors are {1, 7, 2, 5, 3}. 
    - Node 2 is already visited, so we look at the next neighbor.
3. Visit node 1. The neighbors are {0, 2, 6, 5, 7, 3}.
    Nodes 0, 2 are already visited, so we look at the next neighbor.
4. Visit node 6. We've reached our target node.

So a path from node 2 to node 6 does exist. The DFS path taken in this search is:

Node 2 -> Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 6.

Q: Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. The graph is: G describes an undirected graph among node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.The edges in G are: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1.
Node 0 is connected to node 6.
Node 0 is connected to node 5.
Node 0 is connected to node 10.
Node 1 is connected to node 10.
Node 1 is connected to node 5.
Node 1 is connected to node 6.
Node 2 is connected to node 4. 
Node 3 is connected to node 8.
Node 3 is connected to node 9.
Node 3 is connected to node 4.
Node 3 is connected to node 7.
Node 4 is connected to node 8.
Node 4 is connected to node 9.
Node 5 is connected to node 6.
Node 5 is connected to node 10.
Node 6 is connected to node 10.
Node 7 is connected to node 9.
Node 7 is connected to node 8.
The question is: Does a path exist between node 6 and node 7? If a path exists, present the BFS path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If no path is found, state "No path." This problem will be addressed using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Let's think step by step.
A: 1. Start at node 0. The neighbors are {1, 6, 5, 10}.
2. Visit node 1. The neighbors are {0, 10, 5, 6}.
    - Node 0 is already visited, so we look at the next neighbor.
3. Visit node 10. The neighbors are {0, 1, 5}.
    - Nodes 0, 1 are already visited, so we look at the next neighbor.
4. Visit node 5. The neighbors are {6, 10}.
    - Nodes 10 is already visited, so we look at the next neighbor.
5. Visit node 6. The neighbors are {0, 1, 10}.
    - Nodes 0, 1, 10 are visited, so no more neighbors.

So no path between node 1 and 5.

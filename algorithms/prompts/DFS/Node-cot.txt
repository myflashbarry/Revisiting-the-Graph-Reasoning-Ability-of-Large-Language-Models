Q: Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. The graph is: G describes an undirected graph among 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
In this graph:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 2, 5, 3.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 5, 7, 3.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, 6.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, 6.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6.
 The question is: Does a path exist between node 2 and node 6? If a path exists, present the DFS path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If no path is found, state "No path." This problem will be addressed using Depth-First Search (DFS). Let's think step by step.
A: 1. Start at node 2. The neighbors are {0, 1, 3, 4}
2. Visit node 0. The neighbors are {1, 7, 2, 5, 3}. 
    - Node 2 is already visited, so we look at the next neighbor.
3. Visit node 1. The neighbors are {0, 2, 6, 5, 7, 3}.
    Nodes 0, 2 are already visited, so we look at the next neighbor.
4. Visit node 6. We've reached our target node.
So a path from node 2 to node 6 does exist. The DFS path taken in this search is:
Node 2 -> Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 6.

So a path from node 1 to node 5 does exist. The DFS path taken in this search is:
Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 3 -> Node 4 -> Node 5.


Q: Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. The graph is: G describes an undirected graph among 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
In this graph:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 5, 10.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 10, 5, 6.
Node 2 is connected to node 4.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 9, 4, 7.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 10.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 10.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 9, 8.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7.
Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5.
 The question is: Does a path exist between node 6 and node 7? If a path exists, present the DFS path formatted as "Node #1 -> Node #2." If no path is found, state "No path." This problem will be addressed using Depth-First Search (DFS). Let's think step by step.
A: 1. Start at node 6. The neighbors are {0, 1, 10}.
2. Visit node 0. The neighbors are {1, 6, 5, 10}.
    - Node 6 is already visited, so we look at the next neighbor.
3. Visit node 1. The neighbors are {0, 10, 6, 5}.
    - Nodes 0, 6 are already visited, so we look at the next neighbor.
4. Visit node 10. The neighbors are {0, 1, 5}.
    - Nodes 0, 1 are already visited, so we look at the next neighbor.
5. Visit node 5. The neighbors are {6, 10}.
    - Node 10 is already visited, so we look at the next neighbor.
5. Visit node 6. The neighbors are {0, 1, 10}.
    - All neighbors are visited.
Looking at the connections, we notice that none of the directly or indirectly connected nodes from node 6 include node 7.The graph essentially splits into two disconnected components, with nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10 in one component and nodes 2, 4, 3, 9, 7 and 8 in another. since node 7 is not in the same component as node 6, there is no path between node 6 and node 7.
No path.
